 SecureGateway
===============
Secure Gateway (SG) is an architecture concept, using Internet technology in automotive and 
industrial environments. 

This is work in progress, and the source will be released gradually. Now the can4python library 
has been released. It is a Python package for handling CAN signals, and is a key component 
in the Secure Gateway. See a neighbouring repository here on Caran open source portal.

Also the 10+ page tutorial has been released. See the doc folder in this repository.
